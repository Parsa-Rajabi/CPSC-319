## Course Format

Delivery Method: In-person

- [Lecture] Mondays, 17:30-18:50 in **Civil and Mechanical Engineering Building (CEME) 1202** 
- [Project Update Meetings] Wednesdays, 17:30-18:50 in specific group-assigned rooms 

Mondays will be dedicated to lectures and in-class activities. Attendance is encouraged and recoreded through clickers. Wednesdays will be dedicated to project update meetings where each team meets with their assigned TA to discuss project progress, challenges, and next steps. Attendance is mandatory for these meetings.

This course requires significant commitment for both the teaching team and the students. The course is designed to be interactive, with a focus on hands-on learning and practical applications of software engineering concepts. Students are expected to actively engage in group work outside of class time and to collaborate with their peers on semester-long project. A lighter course load is strongly recommended to ensure active participation, high-quality work, and the potential to earn a reference letter or job offer.


## Course Description

> The design, implementation, and test of a large software system, using a team approach. [3-0-2]
[UBC Academic Calender - CPSC 319](https://vancouver.calendar.ubc.ca/course-descriptions/subject/cpscv)

You have learned the basic theories, the algorithms and the data structures that underpin computer science. You have written small programs to demonstrate your understanding of these concepts. Now, it is time to put it all together and build a large software system as part of a team. 

This is not a typical computer science course. There are no lectures on how to write code or improve the efficiency of algorithms. Instead, this course will provide an opportunity for you to apply what you have learned in previous courses to a real world software engineering project. The course will guide you through a real software development lifecycle and teach you the skills necessary to work effectively as part of a software development team.

You will be interacting with a real company/client to gather requirements, design, implement, test and present a software solution to their problem. Working in teams and being able to use your technical, communication, and collaboration skills effectively is a key learning outcome of this course. 

## Pre-requisites (unofficial)

A strong attention to detail, a willingness to learn new problem-solving techniques, and a desire to work collaboratively with others. 

## Learning Goals
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Apply software engineering principles to work in a team on a non-trivial project
- Gain hands-on experience with design and implementation issues
- Adopt industry standards and use them in the programming project
- Collect, synthesize, and evaluate information or data from reliable sources
- Troubleshoot technical problems and propose alternative feasible solutions
- Communicate technical concepts effectively in writing and orally to diverse audiences including non-technical stakeholders
- Demonstrate professional and ethical responsibility in a team environment

## Course Evaluation

The following is a high level breakdown of the course evaluation scheme. A more detailed description of each item will be provided by first week of classes.

|            **Item**             | **Weight** |
| :-----------------------------: | :--------: |
|      Course Participation       |    10%     |
|       Project Milestones        |    20%     |
| Minimal Viable Product Delivery |    30%     |
|     Final Product Delivery      |    40%     |


### Passing Criteria

In order to pass the course:
- Students MUST achieve a minimum of >=50% on the course participation component. 
- Students MUST achieve a minimum of >=50% on the client feedback component of the final project delivery.
- Students MUST achieve a minimum of >-50% on the peer evaluation component of the final project delivery.
- Students MUST be present in-person and participate in the MVP and final product presentations.

Students who fail to meet these requirements will have a final grade of 45% or less.

### Grade Solicitation Policy

Requests for grade adjustments (especially final course grade) based on non-academic reasons are not appropriate and are considered unprofessional. Examples include, but are not limited to, statements such as "I need this grade," "I deserve a higher grade" or any similar personal circumstances.

Students are expected to meet the academic requirements of the course as outlined in this syllabus. Soliciting grade changes undermines the integrity of the evaluation process and may result in a negative impact on your final grade.

If you have concerns about your performance, you are encouraged to seek feedback early and make use of available resources, such as office hours and course support services, to address any challenges proactively.

## Learning Resources

Students in CPSC 319 have diverse backgrounds and learning needs. Various resources are available to help you explore topics of interest in depth. Many students find that just attending lectures and project update meetings is not enough, and you are strongly advised to use the available resources. Note that you should not take needing to seek extra ways to practice what you've learned as a sign that you're "not good at" the material; it's simply that you need more practice. The people in the class who you see who seem to be having no trouble at all have almost certainly had more practice than you (or they're having trouble and don't show it - or both!). Don't freak out. Ask questions and use the help resources: that's what they're for.

TAs and your instructor have office hours. If you require an appointment, contact us with at least a few days notice. TAs are also available during scheduled lab times. (Note that the TAs must prioritize helping students with the scheduled lab assignment.)

Your classmates are an excellent resource for discussion and peer support. In addition to opportunities to chat before and after class, slack is also available.

> [!TIP]
> A note about e-mail support: Many course-related questions require two-way discussion, so e-mail is sometimes not the most efficient way to get help. Office hours and the discussion board should be your first resort for rapid assistance. Please limit e-mail to requests of a personal nature—you'll get faster responses on the course slack!

## Importance of Group Work and Participation Policy

Group work is a vital component of this course, reflecting the collaborative nature of real-world projects. Working effectively in a team is essential for your professional development. It’s important to approach group tasks with respect for each other’s ideas and perspectives, and to ensure that everyone contributes equitably.

Your team's performance in the course project plays a large part in your individual mark. This grade is calculated based on peer evaluations received from your team members, as well as the quality of your contributions to the project. Completing detailed and thoughtful peer evaluations also contributes to your grade.

To maintain fairness and academic integrity, all group members are expected to contribute equally to the project. Here’s how we handle group participation:

1.	**Peer Resolution**: When non-participation issues arise, the first step is for group members to address and attempt to resolve them internally based on the group's agreed-upon terms in the group contract. This includes documenting these efforts—such as meeting notes, emails, or messages on platforms like Slack or Discord—in case further action is required.
2.	**Reporting Non-Participation**: If internal resolution efforts do not succeed, the concerned student(s) should schedule a meeting with their TA. However, it’s important to note that without sufficient evidence of attempts at peer resolution, the TA will not proceed with scheduling the meeting. During the meeting, if scheduled, students should present the documented evidence and discuss possible next steps with the TA.
3.	**TA Intervention**: Following the consultation, the TA may involve other teaching team members to ensure that the workload is fairly distributed and completed by all group members. If additional actions are needed, the teaching team will directly engage with the specific group or individual members to determine the best course of action.

Non-contribution or “free riding” is not acceptable in this course. Every student is expected to contribute meaningfully to group projects. **Repeated failure to participate will result in penalties.** 

## Academic Expectations

In addition to all university rules, regulations, and academic guidelines, the following policies will hold in CPSC 319:

- Attendance and **prompt arrival** is expected at all classes and project update meetings. 
- Bring your development laptop to project update meetings and be prepared to give a live demo of your work every week
- Be professional in interacting with your instructor, TA’s, teammates, and client.
- Be prepared before attending meetings.
- Commit to the team’s goals, communicate honestly with your team, and do your fair share of the work.
- For this course, it is expected that you will spend at least 9 hours per week on out-of-class preparation.

## UBC and Course Policies
---

### Academic Integrity

Academic honesty is essential to the continued functioning of the University of British Columbia as an institution of higher learning and research. All UBC students are expected to behave as honest and responsible members of an academic community. Breach of those expectations or failure to follow the appropriate policies, principles, rules, and guidelines of the University with respect to academic honesty may result in disciplinary action.”  

Students are expected to be familiar with and adhere to the [UBC Academic Integrity guidelines](https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/academic-support/academic-integrity-citations/).

A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, can be found [here](https://academicintegrity.ubc.ca/).

*Failure to comply with any of these responsibilities, either knowingly or through negligence, will also be considered an act of plagiarism and subject to the same penalties.*

### Course Waitlist

- Course waitlists are being handled centrally by the Computer Science department. Go [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses/waitlists) for more information. Students who attend labs will be given waitlist priority.
- If you do not plan to take the course, please remove yourself from the lecture or waitlist, so others may get in.
- Emails to the instructor/TAs about waitlist position will not be answered.

### Late Deliverables 

All course items have fixed due dates and times. Any submission not received by the deadline is considered late. With the exception of live presentations (such as milestone viva voces, MVP presentations, and final product presentations), assignments may be submitted up to 24 hours after the deadline with a 25% late penalty.

Make-up assessments (including clickers, presentations, viva voces) will not be given. Sometimes life gets in the way of schedules. Sickness or other unplanned or extraordinary events happen and will be dealt with individually. It is your responsibility to ensure your situation is known to the instructor and your assigned TA as soon as reasonably possible. You are accountable for being heard, which means you need to ensure that the instructor and TA have heard you.
 
While "life happens," poor planning by you does not count. And definitely do not wait to discuss gray areas. For example, an interview opportunity arises (good!): you should not wait until the day before the submission is due to let us know that you could not complete the submission because you had to prepare for the interview. That would be considered poor planning. Good planning would be to alert the TA or Instructor that you got the interview and, while you hope to finish the submission, there is a concern. Then when you don’t finish on time, it’s clear that you planned your time and that will be taken into consideration. These "good planning" situations will be considered individually as per the instructor's discretion.

In all cases, exceptional situations are considered on an individual basis, subject to the approval of the instructor and supported by legitimate and verified documentation. Refer to accommodations and concessions section below for more details.

### Remarking Policy

As a teaching team, we strive to provide fair and accurate assessments of your work while also providing as much feedback. We encourage you to review the feedback and spend your time/energy where it serves you the most which will be learning from past mistakes and self-improvement. While you reserve your right to ask for a re-grade, we find debating grades an incredible drain on course staff time and energy and prevents us from serving students well and focusing on most important aspects of the course. Regrade requests are not an avenue for you to argue or debate about the grading scheme. Regrade requests are meant as a way for you to let us know about situations where the grading scheme may not have been correctly applied to your work.

If you feel a course item has been incorrectly assessed you may request that the item be remarked. However, before making a remarking request, please complete the following steps:

1. Review the marking rubric and ensure you understand the marking scheme.
2. Review the marking comments and ensure you understand the feedback.
3. Schedule a meeting with the TA to discuss the feedback and marking.
4. If you still feel the marking is incorrect, you may request a re-marking.

#### Request a Remarking

Requests must include a written letter for the re-marking and be submitted to the course TA/instructor within **5 business days** from receiving the mark or a deadline specified by the TA/instructor, whichever comes first. The request must be signed and submitted via email. 

Course grades are considered final on a rolling basis (e.g. as we progress through the semester). After the regrading request deadline (e.g., 5 business days or deadline set by TA/instructor), grades will be considered final and no further requests will be accepted. Students are encouraged to review their grades and ask questions within the specified time frame. Inquiries after the deadline will not be considered.

The re-marking request will be reviewed by the teaching team and if accepted, the item will be re-marked in its entirety by both the course instructor and the marking TA. This may result in a higher, unchanged, or lower mark overall which will be final.
