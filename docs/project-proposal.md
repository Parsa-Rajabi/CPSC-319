# Information for Prospective Project Clients

Thanks for thinking about partnering with students in **CPSC 319: Software Engineering Project** at UBC. This page gives you the essentials: what the course looks like, the kinds of projects that fit, what to expect from a student team, and what we ask of you. There is a proposal link at the end.

## 1. Course snapshot

**CPSC 319** is a senior undergrad software engineering course. Teams of 4–6 students build and demo a working prototype for a real client over one term (January–April). You will have one dedicated project TA who oversees your project from start to finish. That TA meets with all teams, guides decisions, and keeps students on track. Students aim for a functional, demoable solution, though it may need more polish before production.

## 2. Projects we look for

We love projects that have a clear problem and can be scoped to an MVP in one term. The best fits are achievable by a 4–6 person team in roughly two months of focused build time, tied to a real workflow or user problem, and supported by an engaged stakeholder who can give feedback. Using non-sensitive or test data is strongly preferred. Although the term is four months, the first month is team setup and lectures, and the final weeks are exam season, so most hands-on building happens in February and March.

Examples include:

- A simple web app to manage registrations, bookings, or events
- An internal dashboard that unifies data from spreadsheets or other tools
- A workflow tool that replaces an email-and-spreadsheet process
- A lightweight proof-of-concept for a larger idea you are considering

If you are unsure, please still submit — we will help scope it.

## 3. How the project runs

Projects move through a simple arc; below is a rough timeline for this offering.

|       Phase        |       Approximate Timing        |                                What happens                                |                    Your role                    |
| :----------------: | :-----------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------: |
|   Groups formed    |             Jan 19              | Teams of 4–6 are created and matched to projects; TA assignment confirmed. |                  None needed.                   |
|  Project kick-off  |         Week of Jan 19          |   Meet students + TA, review goals, align on scope and success criteria.   | Attend kick-off; share context and constraints. |
|    Requirements    |           End of Jan            |   Students draft requirements/user stories and validate with you and TA.   |        Review and give feedback quickly.        |
|  Design milestone  |            Early Feb            |        Teams propose architecture/approach; adjust scope if needed.        |    Respond to design questions and sign-off.    |
|    MVP delivery    |       Late Feb–Early Mar        |       Core features implemented and demoed; TA keeps teams aligned.        | Give feedback on MVP and priorities for final.  |
| Product development|            March                | Teams refine and extend the product toward final goals.                    | Stay responsive to async questions; if possible, attend TA check-ins so student inquiries get unblocked quickly. |
| Final presentation | April 8, 5:30pm (UBC Vancouver) |                Final demo and docs; public course showcase.                |       Attend if possible; share feedback.       |
|  Project hand-off  |            Mid April            |             Code, docs, and access details transferred to you.             |       Receive hand-off; confirm receipt.        |

## 4. What you can expect

You will get a committed team of 4–6 students for the term, guided by a dedicated TA. Depending on enrolment, three or four teams may be assigned to the same project; they will work with the same TA and build the same application, but approaches and final polish will vary. The upside is that you finish with multiple versions to choose from. Expect regular communication (typically weekly) with the TA and/or the team, a working prototype within the agreed scope, and light supporting documents such as a requirements summary, design overview, basic how-to, and repository links. All source code is transferred to you at project hand-off. Because this is a course, students may be learning new tech as they go, nice-to-have features may be deferred in favor of the MVP, and the final product may need extra polish before production use.

- You get: regular updates, a working prototype, light docs, and the code.  
- You may also get: multiple versions from parallel teams to pick from.  
- You should expect: MVP-first scope, with optional polish after the course if needed.

## 5. What we ask from you

We need a clear problem and context—what you are trying to improve, who the users are, and what “good” looks like. Please plan for a kickoff meeting and periodic check-ins every couple of weeks with the TA and team, and join the final presentation if you can. Quick feedback helps unblock design and prioritization, especially on the initial requirements and design, the MVP, and the final product. If you can, share helpful internal resources such as cloud credits (AWS, Azure, etc.), LLM/API access (OpenAI, Claude, etc.), or test/safe access to internal APIs or databases; these can accelerate the build. If you want to start from an existing code base, we can do that, but the scope will need to reflect the ramp-up time for students to learn it. Keep expectations realistic: this is a prototype, not a commercial contract. At the end of term, we will ask for a short evaluation on communication, professionalism, and usefulness.

- Meetings: kickoff, short check-ins every ~2–3 weeks, and the final showcase if you can attend.  
- Feedback: on requirements/design, on the MVP, and on the final handoff.  
- Inputs that help: cloud/API access or a starter code base (with scope adjusted for ramp-up).

## 6. Data, privacy, and access

Whenever possible, please provide anonymized or test data. If production systems must be accessed, a test or sandbox environment is best. An NDA will be signed by clients and students at the start of the semester. Any additional access requirements should be lightweight and approved by the instructor in advance. Note any privacy or security constraints in your proposal so we can judge feasibility early.

## 8. Submit a project proposal

Ready to propose? Please complete the CPSC 319 project proposal survey:

> **Project Proposal Survey:**  
> 

You will be asked for contact info, a short description of your idea, the users involved, any constraints (tech, data, IP), and your availability for meetings. We will review and follow up with next steps or questions, and we will confirm whether your project is selected for the upcoming term or held for a future offering.
