# Information for Prospective Project Clients

Thanks for thinking about partnering with students in **CPSC 319: Software Engineering Project** at UBC. 

This page should give you a pretty good idea of how the course is structured, what kinds of projects work well, and what to expect if your project is selected. If you have any questions after reading this, please reach out to the instructor, **Parsa Rajabi** (prajabi [at] cs.ubc.ca).

*Propoals will be reviewed on a rolling basis, however, submissions by **Friday, December 12** will be prioritized for selection. Submissions beyond this date may still be considered if spots remain.*

## Course Overview

**CPSC 319** is a senior undergrad software engineering course that provides students with hands-on experience working on real-world software projects in small teams (4–6 students). Students at this level have typically completed most of their core computer science courses and have a solid foundation in programming, data structures, algorithms, and software design principles. 

To complete the course, student teams work with clients (like you!) to deliver a working software prototype that addresses a specific problem or need. Students do not get paid for this work (in fact, they _pay_ tuition to take the course!), but in return, they are gaining more experience, building their portfolios, and making connections with potential employers. We hope to facilitate a win-win situation where clients get useful software solutions, and students get valuable real-world experience. **An ultimate goal is to help employers identify talented students for internships or full-time roles after graduation.**

**What kind of support do you get as a client?**

You will have 1 dedicated project teaching assistant (TA) who oversees your project from start to finish. The course TAs have been carefully selected for their previous work experience, strong technical skills, and ability to mentor students.

Your assigned TA will be the central point of contact between you and the student team. They will help gather requirements, facilitate communication, and ensure the project stays on track. You will also have periodic check-ins with the TA and student team to provide feedback and guidance.


## Projects we look for

We love projects that have a clear problem and can be scoped to a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) in one term. The best fits are achievable by a 4–6 person team in roughly 2 months of focused build time, tied to a real workflow or user problem, and supported by an engaged stakeholder who can give feedback. 

Although the term is 4 months, Janurary is dedicated to team setup and lectures, and April is exam season, so most hands-on building happens in February and March.

Ideally, the project should be challenging enough to stretch students’ skills, but not so complex that they can’t deliver a working prototype. Projects that involve new technologies or domains are welcome, as long as the scope is realistic and the client can provide technical guidance along the way.

Students **are not expected to pay** for any software licenses or cloud services as part of the course, so projects must be feasible within these constraints. If your project requires specific paid tools or services, please consider providing access or credits to the student team. In the past, some clients have provided cloud credits (AWS, Azure, etc.) or API access (OpenAI, etc.) to help students build their solutions.

Some example project types that have worked well in the past:

- A simple web app to manage registrations, bookings, or events
- An internal dashboard that unifies data from spreadsheets or other tools
- An database application to replace spreadsheet-based workflows
- A lightweight proof-of-concept for a larger idea you are considering

If you are unsure, please still submit — we will help scope it.


## Project Timeline

Projects move through a simple arc; below is a rough timeline for this offering.

|       Phase        |       Approximate Timing        |                                What happens                                |                    Your role                    |
| :----------------: | :-----------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------: |
|   Groups formed    |             Jan 19              | Teams of 4–6 are created and matched to projects; TA assignment confirmed. |                  None needed.                   |
|  Project kick-off  |         Week of Jan 19          |   Meet students + TA, review goals, align on scope and success criteria.   | Attend kick-off; share context and constraints. |
|    Requirements    |           End of Jan            |   Students draft requirements/user stories and validate with you and TA.   |        Review and give feedback quickly.        |
|  Design milestone  |            Early Feb            |        Teams propose architecture/approach; adjust scope if needed.        |    Respond to design questions and sign-off.    |
|    MVP delivery    |       Late Feb–Early Mar        |       Core features implemented and demoed; TA keeps teams aligned.        | Give feedback on MVP and priorities for final.  |
| Product development|            March                | Teams refine and extend the product toward final goals.                    | Stay responsive to async questions; if possible, attend TA check-ins so student inquiries get unblocked quickly. |
| Final presentation | April 8, 5:30pm (UBC Vancouver) |                Final demo and docs; public course showcase.                |       Attend if possible; share feedback.       |
|  Project hand-off  |            Mid April            |             Code, docs, and access details transferred to you.             |       Receive hand-off; confirm receipt.        |


## What you can expect

We're looking for 5 well scoped and inspiring projects for this term. Once your project has been selected, you will be matched with an assigned TA and multiple student groups who will work on your project throughout the term. The exact number of teams per project may vary based on enrolment, but typically ranges from 3-4 teams. The upside is that you finish with multiple versions to choose from. 

Throughout the semester, the student teams will work closely with you and the TA to make progress toward the agreed-upon goals. You can expect clear documentation such as requirements, front and back-end design diagrams, and test plans.

All source code is transferred to you at project hand-off. Because this is a course, students may be learning new tech as they go, nice-to-have features may be deferred in favor of the MVP, and the final product may need extra polish before production use.

## What we ask from you

To make this a successful collaboration, we ask for a few commitments from you as the project client:

- A clear problem statement and initial requirements to help students get started. 
  - What is the problem you are trying to solve? Who are the users? What are the key features or workflows?
  - Any constraints or requirements around technology, data, or security?
  - What does success look like for you at the end of the term?

- An engaged point of contact (you or a delegate) who can provide timely feedback and answer questions throughout the term.
    - Students will likely have questions as they gather requirements, design the solution, and implement features

- Availability for a kickoff meeting and periodic (sync or async) check-ins.

- An honest assessment of the MVP and final product, with constructive feedback to help students learn and improve.


## Data, privacy, and access

Whenever possible, please provide anonymized or test data. If production systems must be accessed, a test or sandbox environment is best. 

A UBC-drafted NDA will be signed by clients and students at the start of the semester: [NDA Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16b53WYXqIlNVpjW_n2inU7dGTRw6Dohn/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112924702178360769344&rtpof=true&sd=true).  *Note that this template can not be modified by clients.*

Any additional access requirements should be lightweight and approved by the instructor in advance. Note any privacy or security constraints in your proposal so we can judge feasibility early.
