# Course Project Overview

> [!NOTE]
> This page outlines how the course project works and what is expected of you throughout the semester. Please read it carefully and return to it as needed.

**At a glance**
- This course is centered on a **semester-long, real-world project** with an external client
- The course is **project-based**, not assignment- or exam-driven
- All work is completed in **groups**, there are no individual project options
- Groups are formed by the teaching team and remain fixed
- Weekly **in-person Project Update Meetings (PUMs)** are part of the course structure

---

## Course Project Objectives

This course is built around a real-world software project developed in collaboration with an external client. Rather than completing a series of disconnected assignments, you will work with a team over the semester to design, build, test, and refine a software solution that responds to real constraints and stakeholder needs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a **project-based course**. Your learning will come from sustained collaboration, iterative development, and engagement with both your team and your client.

All students complete the course project in groups. There are **no individual or solo project options**, as collaboration is a core learning objective of the course.

---

## Group Formation

Group formation begins with an **in-class group formation activity on January 5**, which will play a significant role in how teams are formed. In addition, a **group formation survey** will be conducted during the first two weeks of the semester to gather your preferences.

> [!WARNING]
> Attendance at the January 5 group formation activity and completion of the group formation survey are required. There are **no substitutions, extensions, or make-ups** for missing either component.

While student input is taken into account, **all project groups are formed by the teaching team**. This approach is used to support balanced teams and a productive learning experience across the course. Once finalized, groups:
- Remain fixed for the entire semester
- Do not change after formation

Group assignments will be finalized **after the add/drop deadline**.

---

## Project Organization

Due to the large enrollment in the course, **multiple student groups may be assigned to the same project**. Each project is supported by a dedicated **Project Owner (TA)**.

The Project Owner:
- Serves as the main point of coordination between student groups and the client
- Helps clarify expectations and requirements
- Provides guidance and feedback throughout the semester

After groups are formed, students are expected to work together to create a **group contract**. This document establishes shared expectations, communication practices, and role assignments within the group.

> [!TIP]
> The group contract is intended to support clear communication and accountability. It is a tool to help your team work effectively together.

---

## Roles and Responsibilities

All students are expected to contribute as **software developers**. In addition, each student will hold a **secondary role** to support coordination and project execution.

> [!NOTE]
> Secondary roles focus on organization and communication. They do not replace technical contribution, and all students are expected to participate in development work.

Available secondary roles include:
- Project Manager*
- Client Liaison*
- UX/UI
- DevOps
- Test Lead
- Technical Writer
- Technical Lead

Roles marked with * are **required** and must be filled within each group.

---

## Project Client Meetings

Throughout the semester, groups will participate in scheduled meetings with the external client.

An **introductory kick-off meeting** will include all group members and is used to establish shared understanding around goals, scope, and communication.

After the initial meeting:
- Ongoing client meetings include only the **Client Liaison** from each group and the **Project Owner (TA)**

> [!NOTE]
> This structure reflects common professional practice, where a small number of team members act as the primary point of contact with stakeholders.

Client meetings are scheduled based on **client and TA availability**. Students serving in the Client Liaison role are encouraged to have a **flexible schedule**, as meeting times may vary.

</details>

<summary><b>Project Design Document (February 5, 2026)</b></summary>
<details>
The design document outlines the proposed technical solution. It should describe system architecture, major components, data flows, and key technology decisions, and explain how the design supports the project requirements.
</details>

<summary><b>Project Test Plan (February 26, 2026)</b></summary>
<details>
The test plan explains how your team will evaluate and validate the system. It includes testing objectives, types of tests, responsibilities, and criteria for determining whether requirements have been met.

## Project Update Meetings (PUM)

Starting **Wednesday, January 21, 2026**, all groups will attend a weekly **Project Update Meeting (PUM)** with their assigned Project Owner (TA).

**Meeting details**
- **When:** Every Wednesday, 5:30pm–7:00pm  
- **Where:** In person, ICICS building (assigned meeting room)

PUMs provide a structured space to:
- Share progress updates
- Run live demos
- Ask questions and receive feedback
- Participate in short viva voce style check-ins
- Identify and address issues early

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In-person attendance is required for all group members at every PUM.

To support flexibility while maintaining accountability, each student may:
- Miss **one** PUM during the semester
- Attend **one** PUM remotely during the semester

> [!WARNING]
> If you plan to miss or attend remotely, you must notify your group and your assigned TA **at least 8 hours in advance via email**, with group members CC’ed.  
> Not informing the TA in advance will be treated as unexcused and will result in a deduction from the participation grade.

## What Success Looks Like

By the end of the semester, successful teams will have:
- Delivered a working solution for a real client
- Practiced professional collaboration and communication
- Gained experience working through the full lifecycle of a software project

This course is designed to reflect real-world software development practices while providing structured support throughout the semester.


### Resources for working in teams

Though your TAs and instructors will be available to help you with difficult issues, we encourage you first to try to resolve problems with your partner through mature and active communication.

In the past, groups have broken down due to poor communication and decision-making strategies. Understanding the benefits of group work and creating a group charter can enhance group interactions.
