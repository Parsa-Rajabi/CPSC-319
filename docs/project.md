#  Project Details

This page outlines how the course project works and what is expected of you throughout the semester. Please read it carefully and reach out to the teaching team if you have any questions.

## Objective

This course is built around a real-world software project developed in collaboration with an external client. Rather than completing a series of disconnected assignments, you will work with a team over the semester to design, build, test, and refine a software solution that responds to real constraints and stakeholder needs.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a **project-based course**. Your learning will come from sustained collaboration, iterative development, and engagement with both your team and your client.

All students complete the course project in groups. There are **no individual or solo project options**, as collaboration is a core learning objective of the course.

---

## Group Formation

Group formation begins with an **in-class group formation activity on January 5**, which will play a significant role in how teams are formed. In addition, a **group formation survey** will be conducted during the first two weeks of the semester to gather your preferences.

> [!WARNING]
> Attendance at the January 5 group formation activity and completion of the group formation survey are required. There are **no substitutions, extensions, or make-ups** for missing either component.

While student input is taken into account, **all project groups are formed by the teaching team**. This approach is used to support balanced teams and a productive learning experience across the course. Once finalized, groups:
- Remain fixed for the entire semester
- Do not change after formation

Group assignments will be finalized **after the add/drop deadline**.

---

## Project Organization

Due to the large enrollment in the course, **multiple student groups may be assigned to the same project**. Each project is supported by a dedicated **Project Owner (TA)**.

The Project Owner:
- Serves as the main point of coordination between student groups and the client
- Helps clarify expectations and requirements
- Provides guidance and feedback throughout the semester

After groups are formed, students are expected to work together to create a **group contract**. This document establishes shared expectations, communication practices, and role assignments within the group.

> [!TIP]
> The group contract is intended to support clear communication and accountability. It is a tool to help your team work effectively together.

---

## Roles and Responsibilities

All students are expected to contribute as **software developers**. In addition, each student will hold a **secondary role** to support coordination and project execution.

> [!NOTE]
> Secondary roles focus on organization and communication. They do not replace technical contribution, and all students are expected to participate in development work.

Available secondary roles include:
- Project Manager*
- Client Liaison*
- UX/UI
- DevOps
- Test Lead
- Technical Writer
- Technical Lead

Roles marked with * are **required** and must be filled within each group.

---

## Project Client Meetings

Throughout the semester, groups will participate in scheduled meetings with the external client.

An **introductory kick-off meeting** will include all group members and is used to establish shared understanding around goals, scope, and communication.

After the initial meeting:
- Ongoing client meetings include only the **Client Liaison** from each group and the **Project Owner (TA)**

> [!NOTE]
> This structure reflects common professional practice, where a small number of team members act as the primary point of contact with stakeholders.

Client meetings are scheduled based on **client and TA availability**. Students serving in the Client Liaison role are encouraged to have a **flexible schedule**, as meeting times may vary.

---

## Project Update Meetings (PUM)

Starting **Wednesday, January 21, 2026**, all groups will attend a weekly **Project Update Meeting (PUM)** with their assigned Project Owner (TA).

Each group will participate in **weekly Project Update Meetings (PUMs)** with their assigned TA. On average, each group should expect **20–30 minutes** per PUM. In lighter weeks, meetings may wrap up closer to 20 minutes, while heavier weeks may use the full 30 minutes. The **ideal target is 25 minutes**, which allows a **5-minute buffer** between groups. This buffer helps account for transitions between teams and gives the TA a short break to reset.


|       TA & Project        | Location & Capacity | Team A Timeslot | Team B   timeslot | Team C timeslot |
| :-----------------------: | :-----------------: | --------------- | ----------------- | :-------------: |
|     Mahdi - Benevity      | ICCS 146 (Cap: 20)  | 5:30 - 6:00 pm  | 6:00 - 6:30 pm    | 6:30 - 7:00 pm  |
| Mohsen - Surrey Food Bank | ICCS 202 (Cap: 15)  | 5:30 - 6:00 pm  | 6:00 - 6:30 pm    | 6:30 - 7:00 pm  |
|      Liz - Aunt Leah      | ICCS 104 (Cap: 18)  | 5:30 - 6:00 pm  | 6:00 - 6:30 pm    | 6:30 - 7:00 pm  |

### Arriving Prepared
All groups are expected to **arrive at least 5 minutes early**, fully ready to begin. This includes having your computer set up, charged, and any relevant materials open. Being ready to start on time helps keep the overall schedule running smoothly for everyone.

### Assigned Time Slots and Punctuality
Each group has a designated PUM time slot, which will remain consistent throughout the semester unless you are notified otherwise by the course instructor or your project TA.  

All groups must attend during their assigned time.

> [!NOTE]
> Punctuality is important. Late arrivals will be recorded and count against your participation grade. As a reminder, maintaining attendance in both lectures and PUMs is a passing criterion for the course.

### Client Attendance
In some weeks, your project client may attend the PUMs. When this happens, the client meeting will typically take place during the first ~30 minutes. The remaining PUMs will then run on a reduced schedule, usually 15–20 minutes per group, to accommodate the time spent with the client.

For example:
- 5:30–6:00 pm: Client meeting  
- Remaining groups: 15–20 minute PUMs each, depending on time available

### Use of Remaining Class Time
Since individual PUMs will take no more than 30 minutes, the remaining hour of class time is expected to be used for team meetings and project work. Because everyone is already registered and present for the course, this time should be treated as your default weekly team meeting time.

### PUM Format
Regular PUMs will follow a **stand-up format**, focusing on:
- What you have completed since last week  
- What you plan to work on before next week  
- Any blockers or challenges you are facing  

There will also be time for **questions and discussion with your TA**.

PUMs will also provide a structured space to:
- Share progress updates
- Run live demos
- Ask questions and receive feedback
- Participate in short viva voce style check-ins
- Identify and address issues early

### Attendance Expectations
PUMs take place during scheduled class time, therefore **all students are required to attend**. Please refer to the **absence policy below** for details on how missed PUMs are handled.

To support flexibility while maintaining accountability, each student may:
- Miss **one** PUM during the semester
- Attend **one** PUM remotely during the semester

> [!WARNING]
> If you plan to miss or attend remotely, you must notify your group and your assigned TA **at least 8 hours in advance via email**, with group members CC’ed.  
> Not informing the TA in advance will be treated as unexcused and will result in a deduction from the participation grade.

## What Success Looks Like

By the end of the semester, successful teams will have:
- Delivered a working solution for a real client
- Practiced professional collaboration and communication
- Gained experience working through the full lifecycle of a software project

This course is designed to reflect real-world software development practices while providing structured support throughout the semester.


### Resources for working in teams

Though your TAs and instructors will be available to help you with difficult issues, we encourage you first to try to resolve problems with your partner through mature and active communication.

In the past, groups have broken down due to poor communication and decision-making strategies. Understanding the benefits of group work and creating a group charter can enhance group interactions.
