# Code of Conduct

CPSC 319 is designed to reflect a real-world software engineering environment. This Code of Conduct outlines the expectations for student behavior and professionalism throughout the course. 

By remaining enrolled in this course, students agree to uphold these expectations:

## Treat Others as How You Would Like to Be Treated

You are expected to act in a professional and respectful manner at all times. This includes arriving prepared and on time, communicating clearly and courteously, engaging constructively in discussions, and following course policies and procedures. Disagreements should be handled professionally, with a focus on collaboration and problem-solving rather than personal criticism.

Arriving late, unprepared, or disengaged from class activities is a reflection of your professionalism that will be noted by your peers and most importantly, your client. Similar to a job, there will be consequences for repeated unprofessional behavior.

Respect for others is fundamental. Discriminatory, harassing, or exclusionary behavior will not be tolerated. All members of the course community are expected to contribute to an inclusive and supportive learning environment.

## Teamwork, Integrity, and Accountability

Team-based work is central to this course. Students are expected to contribute meaningfully and equitably to their teams, communicate honestly about progress and challenges, and take responsibility for their individual commitments. 

Speaking up early or asking for help when facing difficulties is a sign of professionalism, not weakness.

Academic integrity and ethical practice are essential. All submitted work must be honest and appropriately attributed. Students are expected to act responsibly when designing, implementing, and testing software, including respecting ethical considerations such as user trust, privacy, and professional responsibility. 

In situations where data privacy or ethical concerns arise, students should consult with the teaching team to ensure appropriate handling. Students are responsible to be aware of and comply with relevant laws, regulations, and institutional policies related to data privacy and ethics in software development.

## Responsibility 

Course flexibility exists to support students when unexpected situations arise and must be used responsibly and in good faith. Students are responsible for understanding and following this Code of Conduct and all related course policies.

Failure to meet these expectations may result in warnings, participation or grade penalties, impacts on peer evaluations, or referral to departmental or university processes, depending on the nature and severity of the issue.
