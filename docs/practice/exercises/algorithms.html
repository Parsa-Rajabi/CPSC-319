By repeatedly doing this, you eventually come to a point where your problem is small enough to solve. You solve each of the small problems and put those answers together to solve your big problem.</p>

	                 	<p>Lucy runs a business that breaks bills (i.e., people give her money and she gives them the equivalent amount in smaller denominations). For example, someone may give her &#36;60 and she might give them two &#36;20s and two &#36;10s. Her business has the following bills available for creating change: &#36;1, &#36;5, &#36;10, &#36;20, &#36;25, &#36;50, and &#36;100. To avoid having to always go to the bank to get more bills, Lucy wants to give each customer the least amount of bills possible.</p>

	                    	<p>Greedy algorithms are when you choose the best solution for your current situation regardless of whether or not that leads to the most optimal solution. Sometimes the solution that a greedy algorithm comes up with is the same as the optimal solution, and sometimes it is not. For example, if Lucy wanted to make change for &#36;30, returning one &#36;25 bill and one &#36;5 bill would be the best solution and it would also be the solution that our greedy algorithm leads us to. Now, consider the case where someone gave Lucy &#36;40. The greedy algorithm would tell Lucy to give one &#36;25 bill, one &#36;10 bill, and one &#36;5 bill. However, the best solution in this case would be to break the &#36;40 into two &#36;20 bills.</p>

	                    	<p>A brute force algorithm should be a last resort to solving a problem. While there is a time and place to use brute force algorithms, we generally try to avoid it because it almost always takes longer to find a solution than other types of algorithm. Taking the time to create an algorithm that could discard some potential solutions solutions to check will save you time in the long run.</p>

	                    	<p>When considering which algorithm has a lower cost, we consider how long it takes an algorithm to find an answer. When we talk about &#34;how long&#34;, we are not actually referring to the time a computer takes to solve the problem&ndash; we are referring to how many steps an algorithm takes to find an answer in the worst case scenario.</p>

	                    	<p>With Algorithm A, we need to scan the list of numbers repeatedly until we find the answer. Given our example list (10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1), we need to scan the list of numbers ten times. With Algorithm B, we only need to scan the list of numbers once to find the answer.</p> 

	                    	<p>In our example, our list only has ten numbers so taking longer to solve the problem isn&#39;t much of an issue. However, imagine we had a list of numbers that was a hundred thousand or a million numbers long. In that situation, the difference in the number of steps between Algorithm A and B would be huge. Algorithm A would start to take longer and longer to find an answer.</p>
