# AI-usage Course Policy

This course is designed to reflect real-world software engineering. In practice, teams use AI tools, but they do so with clear expectations around **ownership, safety, and professionalism**. This policy is meant to help you use AI in a way that supports your learning and protects your team, your client, and your project.

## Client policy comes first

Each client project may have its own AI usage policy. **You are expected to ask your client (early) what they allow and then follow their guidance.** If the client’s expectations are stricter than this course policy, the client policy overrides.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a client says “no AI for X,” then it’s “no AI for X,” even if this course policy would normally allow it.

## AI-focused projects

Some projects are entirely AI-based. If you are assigned to one of these projects, **using and developing AI solutions is expected and required** as part of the work.

If you are not comfortable with this, you should **contact the course instructor as early as possible** so we can discuss options.

## What AI use is acceptable in this course

AI is allowed when it supports your work without replacing your understanding or accountability.

### Generally acceptable uses

- **Learning and understanding**
  - Asking for explanations of concepts, APIs, errors, or code you are reading
  - Using AI like a “rubber duck” to think through approaches

- **Brainstorming and design support**
  - Generating options for features, UX ideas, architecture alternatives, or risks
  - Comparing tools and libraries (you still need to validate with sources and your own testing)

- **Debugging and testing support**
  - Asking for debugging hypotheses, steps to reproduce, or potential root causes
  - Drafting test plan outlines or example test cases, then refining and validating

- **Writing support**
  - Proofreading for grammar and clarity
  - Formatting help (tables, Markdown, LaTeX, slide structure)

## What AI use is not acceptable

AI is not allowed when it undermines learning, ownership, integrity, or safety.

### Unacceptable uses

- **“Vibe coding” or shipping code you don’t understand**
  - Copy/pasting code into your repo without being able to explain it
  - Merging AI-generated changes that you did not review carefully

- **Uncredited AI use**
  - Using AI in written reports, presentations, or README content without a disclosure statement (see below)

- **Sensitive or private information**
  - Uploading or pasting client confidential information, proprietary code, personal data, secrets, tokens, API keys, `.env` contents, credentials, or internal documents into AI tools

- **Letting AI make decisions for you**
  - Using AI to choose your architecture, requirements, or scope without your team being able to justify those choices

> [!WARNING]
> If you share secrets (tokens, keys, environment variables) with an AI tool, treat that as a security incident. Rotate the secret immediately and tell your TA.

## The standard: you own what you submit

No matter what tools you use, you are responsible for what you submit and deploy.

If AI contributes to code, you should be able to answer questions like:
- What does this code do, at a high level?
- Why is it correct and safe?
- What tests did we run to confirm it?
- What are the risks or tradeoffs?

A good rule: **If you can’t explain it, don’t ship it.**

## Required AI disclosure statements

All written reports, presentations, and your code repository README **must include an AI disclosure statement**. This is required even if the answer is “no AI was used.”

Put it somewhere visible:
- Reports: near the end, or in a short “AI Use” section
- Presentations: final slide or speaker notes
- README: near the top or in a dedicated “AI Use” section

### Copy/paste templates

**Option A, no AI used**
> **AI Use Disclosure:** No generative AI tools were used to produce this submission.

**Option B, writing support only**
> **AI Use Disclosure:** Generative AI tools were used for proofreading and clarity edits. All technical content and decisions are our own.

**Option C, brainstorming and learning**
> **AI Use Disclosure:** Generative AI tools were used for brainstorming and to support learning (concept explanations, alternative approaches). Final decisions were made by the team and validated through implementation and testing.

**Option D, code support with verification**
> **AI Use Disclosure:** Generative AI tools were used to suggest code snippets and debugging ideas. The team reviewed all output, adapted it to our codebase, and validated it through testing and code review.

**Option E, AI-focused project**
> **AI Use Disclosure:** This is an AI-based project. Generative AI tools are used as part of the solution development, along with human review, testing, and documentation of design decisions.

> [!TIP]
> Keep your disclosure short, but specific. A good disclosure says how AI was used, not just that it was used.

## Disclosure enforcement and grade impact

Disclosures are required.

- **First missing disclosure:** You will receive a warning (no grade penalty).
- **After the first warning:** Any future submission missing the required disclosure will receive a **10% deduction** for that submission.

This applies to reports, presentations, and the repository README.

## If you’re unsure

If you are not sure whether something is allowed, ask your TA early. When in doubt, default to:
1) don’t share sensitive info  
2) don’t ship what you don’t understand  
3) disclose your use


## If you do not wish to use these tools, that is a valid decision.

The use of AI tools in education can be messy and unpredictable due to the risks mentioned earlier. Some students may have moral confusion or concerns about the uncertainty associated with using AI tools in their coursework. **If you do not wish to use them, that is a valid decision.** This policy aims to anticipate and mitigate any potential harms associated with AI tool usage, rather than promoting their use.

## We will not mark you down for the use or non-use of AI tools.

Grading will be done based on the rubric on an absolute scale, the use of AI tools will not negatively impact your grade.

**Please note that the policy about the use of AI tools in this course is up for change as the term progresses. Changes will be communicated in-class and via this page.**
