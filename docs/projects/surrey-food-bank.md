## About the project
The Surrey Food Bank is currently experiencing operational challenges that are affecting service efficiency and client experience. A significant increase in appointment-related phone calls has led to extended wait times, making it difficult for clients to connect with staff in a timely manner. At the same time, the registration process has become increasingly time-consuming. Many clients face language barriers, and others arrive without the required documentation, resulting in repeated visits and longer intake times.

To address these issues, the Surrey Food Bank is seeking to implement a comprehensive appointment management and client registration system. This system aims to streamline appointment scheduling, reduce phone call volumes, and enhance the overall registration process.

The platform should be intuitive and user-friendly for both clients and staff. Clients should be able to easily book, modify, or cancel appointments online, reducing the need for phone calls. The registration process should be simplified, with clear instructions and support for multiple languages to accommodate diverse client needs. The system's maintenance and updates should be manageable by non-technical staff, ensuring that the organization can adapt to changing requirements over time.

## Intended users
- Clients of the Surrey Food Bank seeking food assistance
- Staff members responsible for managing appointments and client registrations

## Required Technology
- No specific technology stack is mandated; however, the solution should prioritize usability, accessibility, and ease of maintenance.
