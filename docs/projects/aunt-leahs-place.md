## About the project

At Aunt Leah’s Place, staff compile detailed case notes while supporting individuals and families as they are intake into various programs. These notes help track each person’s journey, needs, and outcomes over time. However, the current case management system does not fully support the organization’s day to day needs or long term reporting goals.

Ease of use is a major priority. Staff need a system that is simple to learn, efficient in daily workflows, and ideally even enjoyable to use. Onboarding new staff should be straightforward and should not require extensive technical training or reliance on workarounds.

The organization’s needs also evolve over time. As programs grow or change, staff may need to track additional information such as housing status, income sources, or other indicators that become relevant. A strong solution should make it easy to customize what is tracked and allow new fields to be added without significant technical effort.

Data portability is another important consideration. Staff want to be able to move information in and out of the system with minimal friction. This includes the ability to import and export trackable data using tools like Excel, upload and attach documents to case files, and transfer data easily if systems change in the future.

Beyond individual case notes, the organization needs a way to aggregate data across programs. For example, they may want to determine what proportion of participants in the Housing program are in market housing, supported housing, or experiencing no housing. They also want to combine data from multiple programs, remove duplicate records, and identify unique individuals. Clear reporting and visualization features such as charts and graphs are important for decision making and communication. Critically, any reporting or analysis must be done without using AI tools that send sensitive data outside the organization, in order to maintain privacy, trust, and ethical data practices.

## Constraints and considerations
The system must meet federal privacy standards and ensure secure handling of sensitive data. System relaiability is also a key concern, as staff need to access case notes and information without interruptions or downtime.

## Intended users
- Social workers and case managers at Aunt Leah's Place

## Required Technology
