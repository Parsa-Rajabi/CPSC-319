# Enterprise AI Agents for Social Impact

## About the organization
Benevity is a Calgary-based software company that provides a corporate purpose platform supporting corporate social responsibility initiatives. Founded in 2008, Benevity helps global enterprises manage and track employee giving, volunteering, and grant-making programs, processing billions of dollars in donations annually. The platform enables organizations to engage employees, customers, and communities through vetted nonprofit partnerships.

## About the project
This project explores the design and development of enterprise-grade AI agents that support social impact initiatives within Benevity’s ecosystem. AI agents are positioned as autonomous systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing tasks, going beyond content generation to action-oriented workflows.

The project is structured as an exploratory research and development initiative rather than a fixed-specification build. Student teams are expected to operate as product researchers and solutions architects, identifying high-value problem areas and designing production-ready solutions using Benevity’s cloud and AI stack.

## Project goals
- Identify and validate a high-impact AI agent use case within Benevity  
- Design and implement a functional AI agent prototype  
- Integrate the solution into Benevity’s existing technical ecosystem  
- Demonstrate how AI agents can support social impact and corporate responsibility workflows  

## Intended users
- Internal Benevity teams involved in product development and social impact initiatives  
- Corporate clients using Benevity’s platform  
- Donors and employees engaging with giving, volunteering, and nonprofit programs  

## Key features or deliverables
- Strategic analysis report summarizing stakeholder interviews and use-case selection  
- A functional AI agent prototype deployed on Google Cloud Platform  
- End-to-end workflow demonstrating data ingestion, reasoning, and user-facing output  
- Technical documentation including architecture diagrams and design rationale  

## Constraints and considerations
- The solution must be deployed on Google Cloud Platform  
- AI services must use Vertex AI and Google Agent Builder / Agent Development Kit (ADK)  
- The project involves navigating ambiguity and evolving requirements  
- Reliability, autonomy, and enterprise readiness are emphasized over proof-of-concept scripting  

## Technology
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)  
- Vertex AI  
- Google Agent Builder / Agent Development Kit (ADK)  
- Python for AI workflows and agent logic  
- Java for backend integration where required  
- Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Docker, and APIs  

## Timeline and availability
The project is divided into two phases:
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1–2):** Discovery and validation through internal stakeholder interviews and use-case evaluation  
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 3+):** Implementation and prototyping of the selected AI agent solution
