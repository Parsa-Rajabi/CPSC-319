# Feathers JS v6

## About the organization
Feathers Cloud is the company behind FeathersJS, an open source web framework for building real-time applications and REST APIs using JavaScript or TypeScript. 

FeathersJS is an open source full-stack web-framework for creating APIs and real-time applications with TypeScript or JavaScript. It can interact with any backend technology, supports many databases out of the box and works with any frontend technology like React, VueJS, Angular, React Native, Android or iOS. The project has been around for about 12 years and gathered around 15k GitHub stars with more than 6 million downloads every year.

FeathersJS has been used for a long time by developers all over the world for a variety of projects. Version 5 was released in early 2022, trying to provide a more integrated development experience. It also came with a CLI tool for generating a new project and files that are usually needed in a Feathers project.

## About the project

The goal of the next major release of FeathersJS (v6) is to refocus on the core strengths of the framework while adapting to modern, LLM assisted development workflows. Earlier versions relied on a tightly integrated CLI and static code generation approach, which became harder to maintain as LLM based coding tools emerged and changed how developers scaffold and write code. This new version moves away from custom generators toward a more flexible, LLM friendly approach that allows developers to choose the technologies and workflows that best fit their needs.

Feathers is primarily used to build REST APIs and real time applications. Originally an extension of Express for Node.js, it now supports multiple platforms including Deno, Bun, Cloudflare Workers, and browser based applications using frameworks such as React, Vue, or Angular. It can also be used for local first applications that run entirely in the browser.

Students working on this project will explore how open source tools are used within LLM assisted development environments. This includes researching ways to provide documentation to LLM coding agents, implementing an MCP server as a modern replacement for inflexible CLI generators, and creating examples that demonstrate how Feathers can be used with different technologies. These examples should be useful both to developers, such as through blog posts, and to LLMs through structured interfaces.

Students will contribute to a real world open source project and help shape how it evolves alongside emerging development practices. Success for this project would be a v6 release that emphasizes the framework’s strengths while making it easy for developers to get started, with or without an LLM coding tool.

## Intended users
- Primary users of Feathers are developers who want to create REST APIs and real-time applications. 
- Originally an extension to the Express framework for NodeJS, Feathers now works with many different platforms like Deno, Bun and Cloudflare Workers and in the browser with any Framework like React, VueJS, Angular etc. It also works with local-first applications that run entirely in the browser.

## Required Technology
- TypeScript / JavaScript
- LLMs and related tools (e.g. OpenAI, Claude Code, etc.)
- Deno, NodeJS, Bun, Cloudflare Workers
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
